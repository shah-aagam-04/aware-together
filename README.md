## Getting Started

### Want to use the template?

See the [Template Usage docs](docs/template_usage.md). Otherwise, feel free to keep moving with the setup steps!

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd nuxt-template
```

### 2. Install dependencies

This project uses `pnpm`, but you can use `npm` as well.

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Setup Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and fill in your details.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and configure the following:

- `DATABASE_URL`: The SQLite connection string (default: `file:./dev.db`).
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`: A secure random string for encryption. You can generate one using `openssl rand -hex 32`.
- `BETTER_AUTH_URL`: The base URL of your application (default: `http://localhost:3000`).
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address (for OTP delivery).
- `EMAIL_PASS`: Your Gmail App Password. [How to generate an App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833).

### 4. Database Setup

Initialize your SQLite database and run migrations. You will need to run this command anytime you need to change or create a database.

```bash
pnpm db:migrate
```

During development, if there are any database changes since the last migration, you will need to generate a new migration.

```bash
pnpm db:generate
```

### 5. Start the development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 6. How to Login

Login requires an email address that already exists in the database.

- **Option A: Use the seeded user**
  Go to `/auth` and log in with `email@example.com`.
- **Option B: Use your own email**
  Update `server/db/seed.ts` with your email, then run `pnpm db:seed` to re-seed.

**To get your OTP:**

- Check your configured email inbox.
- **Or**, run `pnpm db:studio` to open **Drizzle Studio** and look in the `verification` table.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Frontend code (pages, components, assets, composables).
- `server/`: Backend code (API routes, authentication logic, database utilities).
- `server/db/`: Database schema and seed scripts.
- `drizzle/`: Generated migrations.
- `public/`: Static assets.

## GitHub Actions Configuration

**Important**: You must update the GitHub Actions workflow to point to your own repository and AWS configuration.

### Update GitHub Actions

Add the following Secrets and Variables to your repository:

1. **ACTIONS_ROLE_ARN (Secret)**:

   ```yaml
   arn:aws:iam::YOUR-AWS-ACCOUNT-ID:role/YOUR-ROLE-NAME
   ```

2. **REPOSITORY (Variable)**:

   ```yaml
   your-repository-name
   ```

Optionally, you may update the AWS region.

3. **AWS Region** (line 26 in `.github/workflows/main.yml`):
   ```yaml
   aws-region: your-aws-region
   ```

### Required AWS Setup

Before the GitHub Actions will work, you need:

1. **AWS ECR Repository**: Create a repository in Amazon ECR
2. **IAM Role**: Create a role with GitHub Actions OIDC provider and ECR permissions
3. **GitHub Secrets**: Ensure your repository has the necessary AWS permissions
